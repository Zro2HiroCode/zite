 Reverse Proxy and Load Balancer Project

 Description
This project demonstrates the setup of a Reverse Proxy and Load Balancer system using 5 Ubuntu virtual machines (VMs). The primary goal is to distribute traffic efficiently across multiple backend servers to ensure high availability and load balancing. Nginx is used as a Reverse Proxy and Load Balancer, while Apache is used for handling the backend API requests.

 Installation

 Prerequisites
Before proceeding, ensure the following software is installed on all VMs:
- Ubuntu 20.04 or later
- Nginx (for Reverse Proxy and Load Balancer)
- Apache2 (for backend API handling)
- PHP and MySQL (on backend servers)

 Steps to Install

1. **Set up the 5 Ubuntu VMs**:
   - VM1: Nginx Reverse Proxy (IP: 192.168.100.1)
   - VM2: Backend Server 1 (Apache) (IP: 192.168.100.2)
   - VM3: Backend Server 2 (Apache) (IP: 192.168.100.3)
   - VM4: Database Server (MySQL) (IP: 192.168.100.4)
   - VM5: Monitoring Server (IP: 192.168.100.5)

2. **Install Nginx on the Reverse Proxy VM (VM1)**:
   ```
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install nginx
   ```

3. **Configure Nginx as a Reverse Proxy and Load Balancer**:
   - Edit the `/etc/nginx/sites-available/default` file to configure upstream servers and load balancing.
   - Example configuration for load balancing:
     ```nginx
     upstream backend {
         server 192.168.100.2;
         server 192.168.100.3;
     }

     server {
         listen 80;

         location / {
             proxy_pass http://backend;
             proxy_set_header Host $host;
             proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
             proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
         }
     }
     ```

4. **Install Apache2 on Backend VMs (VM2 and VM3)**:
   ```
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install apache2
   ```

5. **Install MySQL on the Database VM (VM4)**:
   ```
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install mysql-server
   ```

6. **Configure Database Connections**:
   - Set up a MySQL database and user on VM4 for backend APIs.

7. **Test the Setup**:
   - Ensure that Nginx is correctly forwarding requests to the backend Apache servers.
   - Ensure that MySQL is accessible by the backend servers.

 Usage

1. **Accessing the Reverse Proxy**:
   - Once the setup is complete, you can access the load-balanced application via the IP address of the Reverse Proxy VM (192.168.100.1).

2. **Adding More Backend Servers**:
   - You can scale the backend by adding more Apache servers to the `upstream` block in the Nginx configuration.

 Examples

1. **Example of Load Balancing with Nginx**:
   - Nginx will distribute incoming requests between the backend servers (VM2 and VM3) using a round-robin method.

2. **Example of Database Access**:
   - The backend servers (VM2 and VM3) will connect to the MySQL database on VM4 to fetch or store data.

 Testing

1. **Test Nginx Load Balancing**:
   - You can test load balancing by sending multiple HTTP requests to the Reverse Proxy VM (192.168.100.1) and verifying that traffic is balanced across backend servers (VM2 and VM3).

2. **Test Database Connectivity**:
   - Ensure that the backend servers can connect to MySQL on VM4 by running queries via PHP or MySQL client tools.
